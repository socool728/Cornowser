The modern premium web browser for Android

<sub>If you are looking for a **lightweight and fast** web browser, take a look at [UltimateBrowserProject](http://github.com/Thunderbottom/UltimateBrowserProject)</sub>

<hr />

This browser is intended to be **fast**, **modern** and **inituitive**.
Powered by the Crosswalk Apache Cordova render engine, basing on Chromium, this browser is as powerful and modern, as you get it from modern Chromium releases.

**Warning: **This project is still in development phase.
