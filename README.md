The modern premium web browser for Android. This project is still in development phase.


<hr />

**Important:** The Crosswalk project has been discontinued a while ago. Since it is practically dead and I don't have time for continuing development on this browser as of now, this project is (at least temporarily) discontinued.

Cornowser is intended to be **fast**, **modern** and **inituitive**.
Powered by the [Crosswalk rendering engine](http://crosswalk-project.org), basing on Chromium, this browser is as powerful and modern, as you get it from latest Chromium releases.

Also visit our [XDA thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-cornowser-t3287890)!

I, [xdevs23](http://github.com/xdevs23), do the main work on this project, [Thunderbottom](http://github.com/Thunderbottom) helps and supports me. We also have some translators for our app. Please visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/xdevs23/Cornowser/wiki) to get more information.


<hr />
This browser achieves **486** out of **555** points in the [Beta HTML5Test](http://beta.html5test.com).
**Note:** due to changes in the Beta HTML5 Test, all scores are now lower. Please don't consider the updated screenshots as a worse score than before.
Google Chrome for Android achieves **488** points.

According to these results **this browser is ready for HTML5**.
